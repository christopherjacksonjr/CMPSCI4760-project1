### Spin up

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
* [MAMP Pro](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/)
* [Sequel Pro](https://sequelpro.com/)

**If you have the above installed, run these commands in order:**

1. Create directory for a new project using a short name, ie: 
1. Clone this repo into project directory
1. Create a database in Sequel Pro for the project, named something related to project ie: 
1. Modify file `wp-config.php` to match new database connections
1. Use MigrateDB Pro to pull the database from the production site 
1. If you are making style changes - the process for making style changes is currently broken. We are working on getting this fixed. Until then we have been making minimal changes directly in `style.css`
1. Start coding!
